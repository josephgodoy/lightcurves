  LightCurves is a simple set of programs and scripts designed to find relativistic
  Romer delay times in eclipsing planetary systems. This is done by fitting inverted Gaussian
  functions to primary and secondary transit curves, locating their centroids, and comparing
  the time differences between them. 

  Dependencies:
  Python 3.5.X (Anaconda custom build), NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
